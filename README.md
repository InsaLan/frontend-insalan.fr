# Insalan Frontend

## Description

This is the frontend of the Insalan website. It is a Vue.js application. It is served by a Nginx server. It is part of the [insalan.fr](https://insalan.fr) infrastructure and is deployed with the [infra-insalan.fr](https://github.com/InsaLan/infra-insalan.fr) repository.

## Contributing

Please read carefully [the CONTRIBUTING.md file](CONTRIBUTING.md) before any
contribution.

## Run the frontend in local

The frontend has to be deployed from the docker-compose setup (so you need to install it!).
Please refer to [this README](https://github.com/InsaLan/infra-insalan.fr/blob/main/README.md)

Once the docker-compose is running, you can access the frontend at `http://beta.localhost` if you are using the default beta configuration.
