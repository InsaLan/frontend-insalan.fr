# InsaLan Frontend

## Description

This is the frontend of the InsaLan website. It is a Vue.js application. It is
served by a Nginx server. It is part of the [insalan.fr](https://insalan.fr)
infrastructure and is deployed with the
[infra-insalan.fr](https://github.com/InsaLan/infra-insalan.fr) repository.

## Contributing

Please read carefully [the CONTRIBUTING.md file](CONTRIBUTING.md) before any
contribution.

## Run the frontend in local

The frontend has to be deployed from the docker-compose setup (so you need to
install it!). Please refer to [this
README](https://github.com/InsaLan/infra-insalan.fr/blob/main/README.md)

Once the docker-compose is running, you can access the frontend at
`http://beta.insalan.localhost` if you are using the default beta configuration.
